    Meetup RSVP'er
    --------------

    The purpose of this script is to automatically RSVP yes to upcoming events
    on http://www.meetup.com.

    ## Setup
    1. You must edit API_KEY and MEMBER_ID to reflect your personal details.
       Instructions are below.
    2. Run the script with the --set-groups option. This is a onetime setup
       process where you specify which of your groups to auto RSVP for. You can
       rerun this option at any time, or manually edit the CONFIG_FILENAME.

    ## Execution:
    Simply run the script with no arguments. All script activity is printed
    to stdout. It would make sense to run this script with cron.

    ## Caveats
    * The Meetup API currently doesn't let you RSVP yes to an event where you
      would be added to the waiting list. The script will output a message when
      this happens. Then you would have to RSVP manualy through the website.
    * I have no idea how it handles events that require payments but I can
      guarantee it's not going to work.    
    * The Meetup API has a rate limit. It is fairly large, so you shouldn't run
      into any issues if you only run this hourly. However, the script does not
      check any of the rate limiting information. So, you might run into rate
      limits if you (1) Run the script too often (2) are a member of a large
      number of groups with a large number of upcoming events.
